1. Usage.
2. Implement detail.
3. Practice

To implement collect kernel states as syzkaller resource, we have to follow the next steps:

1. Build kernel with GEPOperator tracker instrument.
2. Support collecting kernel state in syzkaller.
3. Weighted kernel states for fuzzer.

## Usage

### Kernel instrument

First, we need to implement a [LLVM pass](../static_analysis_tools/kern_instrument/AssignTrackerPass)  to do instrument. While we already knew, lots of states of kernel are located in some field of structure. Tracking the store operation of a variable of GEPointer can detect states which may help to fuzzer. Then, refer to [this document](https://llvm.org/docs/WritingAnLLVMPass.html) to build you compiler with field assignment tracker. While building kernel, you have to add line such like:
```  
CFLAGS_*.o = -Xclang -load -Xclang PATH_TO_YOUR_PASS.so -fno-discard-value-names
```  
to Makefile for the object file you need to instrument it. The kernel state id is the crc of file name, structure name and field name.
If you want track the whole kernel, try to add the mentioned CFLAGS to kcov-flag-$(CONFIG_CC_HAS_SANCOV_TRACE_PC).

### Implement the instrument function in kernel

Refer to our [implement](../static_analysis_tools/kern_instrument/kern_patch) of instrument to collect kernel state. Then, build your kernel as usual.

### Patch syzkaller

Clone syzkaller, run:
```  
cd PATH_TO_SYZ_SRC
git checkout ff4a334
git apply PATH_TO_harbian-qa/syz_patch/*.patch
```   

build syzakller as usual. Add the following line to configure file:

```  
"kstate_filter": {
        "files": ["which_source_file_to_track", "base_on_filename_crc"],
        "states": ["which_struct_field_to_track", "base_on_struct_field_crc"]
    },
```  

You can use our tool [kstate_map](../static_analysis_tools/IRParser/kstate_map.cpp) get the kernel state map. run:

```  
clang++-10 kstate_map.cpp -o kstate_map -O0  -g -fsanitize=address `llvm-config-10 --cxxflags --libs --ldflags --system-libs`
./kstate_map LLVM_IR_DIR ASM_DIR VMLINUX FUNCTION_LIST LOG_DIR
```  

FUNCTION_LIST has the functions name we need to get their addresses.
IR_DIR: directory all the LLVM ir code we need.
LOG_DIR: after run the command, kstate_map will creat a "*.json" and a "*.state.map" for every function.
Write the output to PATH_TO_KERNEL_STATE.map. And run patched syzkaller as usual. This map assigns weight base on the frequency of state using. 

## Kernel state base fuzzer
Now, you can run syzkaller as usual, and you can find there is a list of kernel states if you access a "\input" interface. You can also get states weight of every prog in "/corpus" interface.

## Implement detail of kernel state resource

### Kernel instrument

We reuse the KCOV interface instead of using a separate mode. So, we encode the state id with 0xefe at the highest 12-bit. While syzkaller gets a kcov pc started with 0xefe, it realizes this pc is a kstate id and the value and address of the state will occupy the followed 2*64-bit. No matter how many bit the variable is, we formalize to 64-bit. Noted if you want to collect other information, you have to implement a corresponding syzkaller for it.

### Syzkaller support

#### executor

syz-executor have to pick out kernel states and send them out after all signal was sent. These handling can be found in our patch for executor.cc function write_coverage_signl. While executor read a pc started with 0xfefe, that means it receives a kernel state. And we use a chunk of shared memory for this state after coverage signal shared memory. syz-fuzzer will handle them later.

#### syz-fuzzer

Correspondingly, parseOutput in pkg/ipc.go is called by fuzzer and we add a readKernState for parse the executor output. And these kernel states information will be put into a structure called KernState in pkg/kstate/kstate.go. Every input from executor has an array for kernstate, and every prog has a state weight calculated from kernstates. Also, KernState support searching the map by its ID or ID^Value which called their hash.

syz-fuzzer/fuzzer.go: calStateWeight will calculate the resouce weight of a prog. Minus count for eliminating the influence of the length of kstate. prog/rand.go: chooseReaProgramIdx function implement a prior choice of prog base on its states weight

## Kernel state guide fuzzing practice

We have explored two ways in assigning weight to resources.

#### Get frequency of using kernel state

This tool is what we mentioned above kstate_map. We use LLVM api static analyze the using of states in target functions. Without any awareness of the value of a state, it just encourages fuzzer to preferentially choose and extract those progs that frequently rewrite important states. In other words, the prog has complex states.

#### Specify kernel state value weight

We use a [clang checker](../static_analysis_tools/ConditionChecker/) to get symbolic information of condition constraint:

```  
clang -Xclang -analyze -Xclang -analyzer-checker=debug.ConditionChecker  ...... -c -o *.o *.c
```  

You can get some constraint value of variables. And patched syzkaller support a hash mode, if a ID^value can be found in the kstate map, use it as a unique state. So, you can specify a weight for a state with special value. Now, it can be specified in kstatemap manually only.
